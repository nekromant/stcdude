Misc research notes. 
Due to the fact, that the vendor is retarted (in places) not willing to open up
the protocol, we have to do it our own way. 


Reading current MCU settings:

PC starts by sending out 2 0x7f's every ~15ms
MCU calibrates TX based on that, and shits out a bunch of bytes 
The first 4? look like the magic that stands for partnumber.
The are also a few bytes that look like several timer values. 
Probably for XTAL value determination.
All the rest is WiP. 

While now the effort is to feed the captured data back to the software. 
While now it's somewhat failing (FTDI gives framing error on Logical Probe.) don't yet know why.
Trying to simulate that with AVR should prove useful
