Compiling & Installing
----------------------

You'll need autotools, lua dev packaes, 
5.1 or 5.2 would do. 
Then the usual autotools dance:

autoreconf --install --force
./configure
make
sudo make install


The serial dongle problem
--------------------------

It does look like a few serial port dongles do NOT
properly support tcdrain. e.g. it returns while some 
bytes are still IN the hardware TX fifo. This is why 
stock STC ISP software doesn't work with them under wine.
At all.

Workarounds:
1. Use the same upload speed as the handshake speed.  
2. Use -w option. 

stcdude has a workaround for those, -w option adds a delay that
does the tricks in most cases. This part is tricky in places.

Getting .bin file
-----------------

Your firmware should be in _binary_ format. 
You can convert it from intel hex using either hex2bin
or srecord packages (Whichever you like)

Example for hex2bin:
	hex2bin input.ihx

Example for srecord:
	srec_cat -Disable_Sequence_Warnings input.ihx -Intel -output out.bin -Binary

Usage
------

Getting info:

stcdude -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1200:57600 
           |                 |   |
	   | 		     |   |
	   |		     |	 |- Upload baudrate
	   |		     |
	   |		     |-- Handshake speed (higher values my not work)
	   |
	   |-Serial port to use

After running this - supply MCU power, and voila.


Flashing something:

stcdude -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 1200:57600 -a wflash -f firmware.bin
	   |		     |	 |    	 |         |
	   |		     |	 |	 |         |- This is the firmware file
	   |		     |   |       |
           |                 |   |	 | - we're writing to FLASH
	   | 		     |   |
	   |		     |	 |- Upload baudrate
	   |		     |
	   |		     |-- Handshake speed (higher values my not work)
	   |
	   |-Serial port to use
